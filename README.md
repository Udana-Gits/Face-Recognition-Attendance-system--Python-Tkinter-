# Face-Recognition-Attendance-system--Python-Tkinter-
I created a face recognition attendance system using Python and initially built the GUI with Tkinter. Due to layout and GUI issues, I moved to a React frontend with a Python-Flask backend for better user experience and cleaner frontend-backend integration.
