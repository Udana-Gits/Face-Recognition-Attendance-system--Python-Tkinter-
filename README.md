# Face-Recognition-Attendance-system--Python-Tkinter-
I created a face recognition attendance system using Python and initially built the GUI with Tkinter. Due to layout and GUI issues, I moved to a React frontend with a Python-Flask backend for better user experience and cleaner frontend-backend integration.

🔍 Project Summary
This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System developed using:

🐍 Python (for the backend logic)

🖥️ Tkinter (initial GUI framework)

📷 OpenCV + MTCNN + DeepFace (for face detection & recognition)

🧠 ArcFace model (embedding extraction)

🧾 Pandas + Excel (attendance logging)

⚛️ React.js (modern frontend for better GUI management and usability)

🌐 Flask (backend API to bridge React and Python modules)

🎯 Motivation
Initially, I used Tkinter to build the GUI, but it posed several challenges with layout control, scalability, and frontend/backend separation.
To solve this, I developed a modular full-stack version using:

A React-based frontend for clean, scalable UI

A Python-Flask backend for face processing and data handling

This structure ensures better performance, responsiveness, and clear separation of concerns.
